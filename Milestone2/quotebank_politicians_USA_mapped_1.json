I hope in the future you will continue with more pithy insight on topics such as polling registered voters versus `likely voters,' polling sample size, and polling sample demographics. In regards to President Trump I believe one to three points should be added to his percentages because of two factors. First, Trump supporters are subject to shaming and public ridicule, even assault, and thus will not announce their support for him. Second, there are many of us who are disgusted with his juvenile narcissistic rants (Twitter) and his impulsive actions (pull out of Syria) and relish the thought of expressing our disgust but ultimately will vote for him for a few key reasons such as judicial appointments and the economy.

That network not only involves Iran but Brunei, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan (a key ally of Iran), and Turkey, together with front groups supposedly pursuing humanitarian and cultural activities. For example, one such group about which details have come to light is the Third World Relief Agency (TWRA), a Sudan-based, phoney humanitarian organization which has been a major link in the arms pipeline to Bosnia.

This resulted from weeks of planning and extensive cooperation among state, local, and federal partners in Virginia and beyond. Virginia's law enforcement and first responders demonstrated tremendous professionalism. I'm proud of their work. I have spoken with Colonel Settle of the State Police, Colonel Pike of the Capitol Police, and Chief Smith of the Richmond Police Department, as well as leaders of the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office, and thanked them for keeping Virginia safe. Thousands of people came to Richmond to make their voices heard. Today showed that when people disagree, they can do so peacefully. The issues before us evoke strong emotions, and progress is often difficult. I will continue to listen to the voices of Virginians, and I will continue to do everything in my power to keep our Commonwealth safe.","speaker":"Ralph Northam","qids":["Q7287916"],"date":1579557336000,"numOccurrences":1,"probas":[["Ralph Northam","0.7684"],["None","0.2316"]],"urls":["http:\/\/wsls.com\/news\/local\/2020\/01\/20\/i-will-continue-to-listen-to-the-voices-of-virginians-gov-ralph-northam-reacts-to-lobby-day-in-richmond\/"],"phase":"E","mentions":[29183],"mentions_qids":["Q373274"]}

{"quoteID":"2020-03-10-012318","quotation":"Donald Trump is using the coronavirus crisis as an excuse to propose a reduction in payroll contributions. This is a Trojan Horse attack on our Social Security system, which will do nothing to meaningfully address the crisis at hand. Other proposals to stimulate the economy, such as restoring the Making Work Pay Tax Credit or expanding the existing Earned Income Tax Credit, are more targeted and provide more fiscal stimulus. They are fairer in their distribution and place no administrative burdens on employers. The only reason to support the Trump proposal above those others is to undermine Social Security. This is true even if borrowed federal funds are substituted for Social Security's dedicated revenue. Under the guise of stimulating the economy, Trump's plan to reduce Social Security contributions would either undermine Social Security's financing or employ general revenue, both of which would set the stage for future demands to cut Social Security. At base, tax cuts do nothing to meaningfully address coronavirus, or even the resulting market panic. We do want to ensure people have the cash they need while they face massive uncertainties around employment and other costs. We want people to stay home as much as needed without having to worry about paying their rent or other costs. What we need most is a robust public health response, which the Trump Administration is utterly failing to provide. Earlier this week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer released an excellent list of steps we should take to combat coronavirus. Their plan includes paid sick leave, free coronavirus testing, and treatment for all. Our government should enact these measures, not slash payroll contributions. And, for supporters of Social Security, their plan, unlike Trump's, will not undermine this vital program.","speaker":"President Donald Trump","qids":["Q22686"],"date":1583812800000,"numOccurrences":1,"probas":[["President Donald Trump","0.5635"],["None","0.2837"],["Nancy Pelosi","0.1528"]],"urls":["https:\/\/www.commondreams.org\/newswire\/2020\/03\/10\/trumps-plan-slash-payroll-contributions-attack-social-security?cd-origin=rss"],"phase":"E","mentions":[164,165,11746,11760,35079],"mentions_qids":["Q380900","Q22686","Q170581"]}
